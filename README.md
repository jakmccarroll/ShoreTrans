# ShoreTrans (2021 version)

ShoreTrans: a simple, rules-based, user-input driven, shoreface translation and sediment budgeting model, that applies the surveyed 2D-profile (not a parameterization), for estimating change to realistic coastlines, resulting from sea level rise and variations in sediment supply, while accounting for armouring, hard-rock cliffs and outcropping rocks.  The tool can be applied to sand, gravel, rock and engineered coasts at a temporal scale of 10â€“100 years, accounting for shoreline trends as well as variability. The method accounts for: (1) dune encroachment/accretion; (2) barrier rollback; (3) non-erodible layers; (4) seawalls; (5) lower shoreface transport; (6) alongshore rotation; and (7) other sources and sinks. 

The ShoreTrans model is associated with the article:
"A rules-based shoreface translation and sediment budgeting tool for estimating coastal change: ShoreTrans" McCarroll et al., 2021, Marine Geology.
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025322721000487

Code is in Matlab.

Some elements presented in the article are still to be added or need testing/improvement, including:
- Time series of shoreface translation with SLR curve
- Probabilistic sampling and Monte Carlo simulations
- Non-erodible layer (rock outcrops) needs further testing
- Optimization routine needs re-writing
